# create2-helpers

create2-helpers is a suite of smart contracts and forge scripts meant to make working with cross-chain deterministic deployments easier and more convenient.

It leverages Forge's default [Arachnid Deterministic Deployment Proxy](https://github.com/Arachnid/deterministic-deployment-proxy) as well as 0age's [ImmutableCreate2Factory](https://github.com/0age/metamorphic/blob/master/contracts/ImmutableCreate2Factory.sol).
